- **Techniques**: Regression, Time Series Analysis.
- **Skills Gained**: Data cleaning, forecasting.

## Steps to Complete a Machine Learning Project

1. **Define the Problem**: Understand the objective of the project.
2. **Collect and Prepare Data**: Gather a dataset and clean it.
3. **Explore the Data**: Visualize and analyze the data.
4. **Choose a Model**: Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm.
5. **Train the Model**: Split the data into training and testing sets, then train the model.
6. **Evaluate the Model**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to assess performance.
7. **Deploy the Model**: Make your model accessible through a web app or API.

## Tools and Libraries

Here are some tools and libraries to help you get started:

- **Python**: The most popular language for machine learning.
